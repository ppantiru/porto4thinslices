      <p>This page contains a few projects and snippets I've done that may be of some relevance regarding technologies I've interacted with.</p>
      <p>Due to the fact that my primary work involves development and problems solving for different clients, much of my main work is not publically available,
        therefor, what is presented here is either kind of old by this point or things that I've done in my free time. 
      </p>
      <h3>This website</h3>
      <p>Built using some of the technologies I have recently found the beauty of, like React, Node.js, GraphQL and MongoDB, as a small showcase of what I can do with them.</p>
      <p>The backend was not really needed for this, but I build one just for demo purposes, like for example the completely useless login system.</p>
      <a className='btn btn-primary' href='https://github.com/ppantiru/TSCV/tree/thinporto' target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Source code</a>
      <br/><br/>
      <h3>The xwiki.com website</h3>
      <p>This has nothing to do with node and react, but it's more of an example of a publically available website I've worked as an architect/lead developer on, with the restriction of using the xwiki platform as a basis.
        But keep in mind this was about 5 years ago, and there are a lot of things I would do differently now.</p>
      <img className='demo' alt='xwiki.com' src='xcom.png'></img><br/><br/>
      <a className='btn btn-primary' href='https://xwiki.com' target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Visit website</a>
      <br/><br/>
      <h3>Launchpad</h3>
      <p>This one's a project I did for myself, after seeing and wanting an <a href='https://www.elgato.com/en/stream-deck'>Elgato stream deck</a>. I was about to buy it but 
      realized it doesn't have official linux support, and also that I can build one myself for little to no cost.</p>
      <p>I already had the hardware; an old tablet that I wasn't using anymore, all I needed was the software which turns out was not very complicated to build, so I had it 
        working within a weekend.</p>
      <p>A server running on my laptop which controlled various scripts and processes, a react client interface accessible from the tablet and voil√† relatively free Stream deck
        that's not even restricted to a limited number of buttons because I have an entire touchscreen to put anything I want on it.
        The beauty is that to add new buttons and functionality, I only need to modify a rather simple <a href='https://github.com/ppantiru/Launchpad/blob/main/command-center-api/Makefile'>Makefile</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main thing I actually use it for is one tap access to remote servers, but for legal and security reasons I cannot easily showcase that.
      </p>
      <p>A little demo:</p>

      <br/><br/>
      <h3>Bash application for backporting automation</h3>
      <p>This one's a bash application built to simplify the process of creating patches and backports between xwiki versions.</p>
      <p>From cherry-picking the needed commits to building them with maven running from a docker container (to avoid the need to actually setup maven beforehand)
        and committing the changes, all done semi-automatically (semi because you still need to feed it some information).</p>

      <h3>Python snippet</h3>
      <p>For a python projects I cannot provide a clear link to an example as they are mainly on private repositories for a reason,
      but what I can share is a snippet from a backup system I've developed a few years back.</p>
